# Tube-Clips

This is a simple youtube video and audo downloader program. This is writen in python-3. The main libraries I used are `tkinter` and `pytube`.
I mainly wrote this program as I have just started learning `tkinter`.

### How to install?

Well installing is pretty easy.<br>
Download the [`Setup.exe file`](https://github.com/s-shifat/Tube-Clips/blob/main/distribution/Setup.exe) and you are good to go.
Then open it, you will know what to do.
##### *Note: Just make sure you give your browser the proper permissions as you are downloading a file with `.exe` extension.*


### How to use?

Using this program is also easy as well.
  * Copy and paste the url of your desired youtube video in the entry box. You can add a single video url or even a playlist!
  * Now press the `Check` button
  * If your url is correct, the program will give you options to choose whether you want to download the *audio only* or *video only* or *both*.
  * Now click on the `Download` button.
  * After downloading, the destination folder will open automatically.
